You are allowed to use build-in function to perform following calculation.\n\n**Pre-requirement**: Please understand the feature of dataset before perform any analysis\n\n1. Mean, Median, and Mode Analysis(Histogram Analysis)\n    - What are the mean, median, and mode of the total bill amounts in the dataset?\n    - Compare the mean and medianâ€”what does their relationship tell us about the data distribution?\n\n2. IQR-Based Denoising (Outlier Removal)\n    - Identify and remove outliers from the total bill column using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.\n    - How does the mean and standard deviation change before and after removing outliers?\n    - Please give Interpretation of Outlier Removal on Total Bill Data\n\n3. Tip Analysis(**Hint**: Please calculate the value after remove the outliers)\n    - Calculate the mean, median, mode, min, max, and standard deviation of tips. (Plot is optional)\n    - Please give Interpretation of these result.\n\n4. Correlation Analysis\n    - Compute the correlation between total bill and tip. Interpret the result.\n    - Compute the correlation between total bill and size of the party. What does the correlation suggest?\n    - Based on all the above analyses, summarize whether higher bills lead to higher tips and whether group size affects total spending.\n\n5. This is thinking question, no coding involves\n    - In order to perform a better understanding of tip behavior, what further analysis idea do you need?",

He collected several variables:\n\n* Format\n    * A data frame with 244 rows and 7 variables\n\n* Details\n    * tip in dollars,\n    * bill in dollars,\n    * sex of the bill payer,\n    * whether there were smokers in the party,\n    * day of the week,\n    * time of day,\n    * size of the party.\n\nIn all he recorded 244 tips. The data was reported in a collection of case studies for business statistics (Bryant & Smith 1995).\n\n* References\n    * Bryant, P.
